Data files format:

For these problem, data files format is as follows:


The first line contains the following data, number of paths, all vertices can be visited and number of vertices.

From the 3th line, each line contains the integer data associated to each customer, starting with the depot:

vertex number
x coordinate
y coordinate
service duration or visiting time
profit of the location
Opening of time window
Closing of time window

For these problem, data files format is as follows:

The first line contains the following data, number of tours, start day,number of vertices.

The second line associties with start/end point:

vertex number = 0
x coordinate
y coordinate
visiting duration = 0
score of the location = 0
Opening of time window
Closing of time window
The remaining lines contain the data of each point. For each point, the line contains the following data:

vertex number
x coordinate
y coordinate
visiting duration
score of the location
Opening hour of the day i, i = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6
Closing hour of the day i, i = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6
